Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered restrictions requiring New Mexican residents to only be in contact with people they live with and only leave their residence for essential trips. The order was in response to the drastic spike in COVID-19 positive cases in New Mexico. The restrictions on social gatherings have provoked students to find new ways to socialize with their peers.",

Amber Dodson, the director of the New Mexico Film Office, has been working toward making the New Mexico film industry more inclusive for women. \"After more research and talking to intimacy coordinators and directors and producers who have worked with (them), it became crystal clear that this was something we need to have in New Mexico,\" Dodson said in an interview with Southwest Contemporary. \"(It's) something that we should put our Workforce Development Funds behind, something that we should get New Mexicans trained up to participate in and to help foster this new role, and to help New Mexico be a leader in the next era.\"",

Despite the sweeping shift of the drug\u2019s legal status, some states have not expunged the records of people who have been convicted of marijuana charges. Racial disparity plays a big role in arrests for marijuana. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Black people in New Mexico are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people. Within Bernalillo County alone, a Black person was almost twice as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession in 2018. This is compared to the nationwide average where Black people are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, the highest disparity from 2010 - 2018. According to Bernadine Hernandez, an assistant professor at the University of New Mexico and a member of both the Prison Divest New Mexico Coalition and the Fronteristxs Collective, private prisons thrive within New Mexico. Inmates, including people with marijuana charges, are most likely to be held at a private prison.",

            "article_description": "The Mountain Goats, the primary musical project of singer-songwriter John Darnielle, have been plenty of things throughout the years. Working with a cast of collaborators, the most consistent for a time being a Panasonic boombox, they started out in the early 90s as an acoustic lo-fi project, releasing albums and cassettes on various small labels.\u00a0 The songs were as terse as they were tense, compressing moments into little sonic shells, carrying the threat of exploding at any second. At the turn of the century their sound collapsed and expanded, and when the Mountain Goats signed to 4AD they added more elements to solidify themselves as a cohesive project, working through variations on themes new and old. It\u2019s always been Darnielle, and, as any fan will tell you, it\u2019s always been much more.",

            "article_description": "In 2007 the New Yorker published a controversial piece by Sasha Frere-Jones titled, \u201cA Paler Shade of White,\u201d in which he mourned the lack of miscegenation across racial boundaries and specifically that of black musical influence into white indie rock. The piece opens with an anecdote of a performance by Arcade Fire, a band he liked. \u201cI realized that the drummer and the bassist rarely played syncopated patterns or lingered in the low registers. If there is a trace of soul, blues, reggae or funk in Arcade Fire, it must be philosophical; it certainly isn\u2019t audible. And what I really wanted to hear, after a stretch of raucous sing-alongs, was a bit of swing, some empty space and palpable bass frequencies.\u201d Though he added the caveat that \u201cthere\u2019s no point in faulting Arcade Fire for what it doesn\u2019t do,\u201d it was enough to move Will Butler, a composer and core member of the expansive band, to rebut the characterization with an audio file in which snippets from the band\u2019s songs were juxtaposed against music from various black musicians, as well as that of older white artists, like the Beatles and the Clash, who took clear influence from those traditions.",

The things worth mentioning though, the important stuff; that stuff resides on your phones, tablets, and desktops. Because 2017, in addition to being another profound year for music streaming, was a great year for music in general. So many artists are stepping out of their comfort zones, hungrier than ever to produce evocative music often influenced by the sociopolitical struggles we've come to be immersed in these days. We here at Daily Lobo Music are big fans of lists, calenders, and innovative music, so we decided to all band together like a tag-team squad of transatlantic Captain Planet music junkies and document what releases made us laugh, cry, jam, mosh, scream, wonder, and go: \"oh dang, yeah I like that\" this year.

Post Malone, formally known as Austin Richard Post, is famous for mixing and matching different genres of music together seamlessly, and this album is a great example of his work. Within the album, Malone has a mix of rap, hip-hop, slow beats and heavy metal, along with a variety of guest appearances including a comeback from the bat-eating man himself \u2014 Ozzy Osbourne. Other features include DaBaby, Future, Halsey, Meek Mill, Lil Baby, Travis Scott, SZA, Swae Lee and Young Thug. Unlike his first two albums \u201cStoney\u201d and \u201cBeerbongs & Bentleys,\u201d this one has a more personal feel to it.

The topic of birth control has been an ongoing discussion since the 1800s and still continues today. Now, there are numerous forms of birth control for women, but still only one for men. According to The Cut and Live Science, it appears the biggest issues in creating a birth control for men is that the medical companies don\u2019t think the pill will sell to the male demographic and that \u201cmen wouldn\u2019t be trusted to take it,\u201d Live Science said. \u00a0 While these two issues are listed as two of the most common problems with the medication, the bigger issue on the medical side is the fact that there is a lot more to target reproductively when talking about male birth control.

Marked mostly by a lacking summer blockbuster season, there were a few surprise hits that kicked off early in the year, along with some later prestige films reliably packing in its conclusion. Perhaps most notable of 2017 was the diminishing returns yielded from franchise film tickets at the box office, indicating at least a moderate degree of audience fatigue toward sequels.

Unfortunately this initial momentum progressively fizzles out throughout the film\u2019s girthy 120-minute runtime. Sabotaged and permanently crippled by her fellow ballerinas, Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is coerced by her uncle, a high-ranking member of Russian intelligence, to serve as bait for a politician.

The Guild Cinema luckily only had a one-night screening of the film so hopefully no one else \u2014 save for the poor unfortunate souls in the movie house on Saturday, July 9 \u2014 will have to subject themselves to this bore of a watch. \u201cDawn\u201d starts out following a couple, Dieter (Fredrick von L\u00fcttichau) and Margot (Luisa Taraz), as they explore a possibly abandoned castle inherited by Margot from some dead family member; I say possibly because, at most points, the film can\u2019t decide if the castle is truly abandoned or not. It would seem so, based on its decrepit and dilapidated state, but the couple spends the night there in a bed with some suspiciously nice white sheets \u2014 however, this is only a minor annoyance in a film as annoying as a crying child in a restaurant, although far less forgivable.",

Protesters were there in demand of safe staffing, safe working conditions and fair wages. Many nurses joined the group in their scrubs while getting off their shift or on break, at 6:30 A.M. A coalition of campus unions were there in support of nurses, including resident physician William Wylie. He works with nurses everyday and said that they are crucial to the hospital. \u201cThey're our eyes, ears and hands. They\u2019re with the patients most of the time,\u201d Wylie said.",

Even after becoming the first Black person in the world to achieve a doctorate of music in tuba performance, White said his greatest accomplishment was coming to the University of New Mexico, where he has the ability to make a difference in others\u2019 lives. The journey he took to get where he is today was no smooth path. As a boy, White found himself unhoused on the streets of Baltimore, fending for himself. White had to imagine luxuries like a warm blanket and full stomach just to get through the night until he was eventually taken in by a local family. This may have saved his life, but the tuba is what shaped his legacy.",

Only four students attended, which is the lowest group Uni Nights have had since switching to virtual events. Coincidentally, the Student Activities Center (SAC) hosted a drag bingo night the week before with over 130 students participating. While drag bingo isn\u2019t quite the same as the more traditional event, the two are similar enough to question the scheduling process of events for both departments. Andrea Marquez, the SAC advisor in charge of coordinating events like drag bingo, said the SAC specifically planned its bingo night earlier in the term because students would have to quarantine after coming to the dorms from out of town.",

Tierra Umi Wilson, also known as UMI, is a 22-year-old singer/songwriter based out of Los Angeles who made a name for herself when she toured with fellow artist Cuco back in 2019. Her virtual concert on Feb. 12 was only available to University of New Mexico students, and about 100 students attended. According to Joe Polack, the executive director of SSE, the idea for the event stemmed from UMI\u2019s previous shows that included meditation alongside a live performance.",

Phil Elverum (Mount Eerie, The Microphones) is best known for his 2001 magnum opus, \u201cThe Glow, Pt. 2,\u201d a lush, mysterious artifact which once won online magazine Pitchfork\u2019s coveted Album of the Year title. But this latest release strips Elverum of his enormous musical and lyrical vocabulary.",

Firstly, Texas-based self-proclaimed American boy band Brockhampton, led by openly gay rapper Kevin Abstract, have elegantly vanquished all rival artists from the scene. Brockhampton released their first full-fledged album Saturation earlier in June, and followed the record up with a sequel in August to critical and commercial acclaim. The collective has plans, allegedly, to release Saturation III in October: making it one of the most hyped records of the year; projecting to hoist up the Brockhampton flag over all of 2017. Secondly, Brockhampton announced Jennifer\u2019s Tour: 23 stops across the mainland United States, with every single show selling out in a matter of days.\u00a0This is the most important part. Brockhampton completely underestimated how popular they became after Saturation. Almost every venue was a bar, or small theater, or glorified living room, all of which were the catalyst for the most intimate, aggressive, passionate, overwhelming series of shows in the past decade.",

They might even be a Radiohead obsessive, and will want to debate how the subtle nuances of \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d make Thom Yorke the greatest musical genius to ever live; they probably even dream of drinking Thom\u2019s tears as he performs in hopes that they may attain some of that genius. Personally, while I consider myself a music fanatic, something about Radiohead has always felt impenetrable. After hearing the near-universal acclaim this band receives, I am left befuddled as to why I am unable to feel the same way. I can barely tolerate beloved records such as Kid A and Hail to the Thief. These albums, known for their experimentation, seem to be totally lacking in any quality that could make a song enjoyable. It is for this reason that I am stunned by how much I love In Rainbows, which turns ten years old this year.",

The audience is being given the controls to fire-start monumental moments of visual art, music, writing, and filmmaking. A multimodal experience. If done correctly, gaming brings out the best in many forms of art and, in turn, is extraordinarily immersive. Good game design implies good music. It\u2019s what accounts for those footsteps in the grass or the soft-humming of a spaceship\u2019s engine in neutral.

The image they create from each song becomes shattered on the next, and so on and so on.\u00a0 The indie pop trio from London recently brought their eccentric, and often bizarre, live show to Sister Bar in Albuquerque on April 8, redefining their signature fusion of indie rock, J-pop and other genres.\u00a0 Sister was nearly-packed as the show began (surprising for a Monday night show), with many of those in attendance donning extravagant costumes and multi-colored hair.\u00a0 Any review of Kero Kero Bonito would be incomplete without the voice and face of the group, lead singer Sarah Bonito. While already a charismatic vocalist, the energy she exuded on the stage served as the linchpin of the entire performance.",

This debate has dominated nearly all conversation around faculty unions in the U.S., which have grown in frequency the past few years.

Their response to a petition from the proposed union \u2014 United Academics of UNM (UA-UNM) \u2014 recommended rejecting the possibility of a union. This is partly because UNM considers adjunct and other part-time faculty to not be \u201cregular, non-probationary employees,\u201d a category they say the Public Employees Labor Relations Act forbids part-time faculty from unionizing.",

Frankly, the opinions expressed by those who supported this bill proved exactly why recent election turnouts have been at some of their lowest points ever.\u00a0 Firstly, one of the most baffling moments of the meeting came during a presentation Victoria Knight, Joint Council\u2019s representative to ASUNM, made to the Full Senate.

Han came to the U.S. in August 2008 as an international student after his unfulfilling studies in computer science in China. Here, he delved into the photography program at UNM, not knowing that this choice would later impact the rest of his life. When Han started his education at UNM, he began applying for a multitude of jobs on campus in order to fulfill the conditions of his international visa. This eventually led to his employment as photo editor, multimedia editor and web editor at the Daily Lobo in 2012.",

When an individual walks by someone else using the app, both devices will exchange the users\u2019 randomly generated personal identification numbers via Bluetooth.

But Garth Davis doesn\u2019t simply rely on immense emotional appeal for his feature directorial debut. He works to make the climax as satisfying as possible, via two hours of compelling and superbly-written narrative that certainly earns its place in the Best Picture race. Chief among the things that elevate \u201cLion\u201d from good to great is the decision to make the story linear, when it could have been told through flashbacks that would have detracted from its magnitude.",

The Finance Committee, which proposes the budget each semester, recommended $689,652 total to be allocated to student groups and organizations, from $690,000 that was available from student fees. That number is right in line with the last two years, when around $691,000 was allocated to groups by ASUNM. Also, as with the last two years, Finance Committee members were forced to make cuts \u2014 at times drastic ones \u2014 across the board from what groups were requesting.

Gray was diagnosed in the summer of 2014 with tuberculosis, after an adverse reaction to an immunization caused a dormant form of the disease in her body to become active. She was in the process of getting all the required shots to work at UNMH, but the diagnosis turned her into a hospital patient instead of an employee.",

I think that a lot of people are in agreement that it becomes more than a sign, that it becomes a destination.

            "article_description": "UNM Women\u2019s volleyball completed their season in a week of intense play, routing UTEP and UNLV at home, but falling to the Air Force Academy in their final match. The Lobos now stand at 16-16 ( or .500) for the season and 7-11 in Mountain West play, which puts them 8th in conference rankings. This is the 10th season that Lobo volleyball has achieved at least .500 for the season in the 11 years that head coach Jeff Nelson has led the program. UNM started the week with a match against the University of Texas El Paso Miners at Johnson. Coming off a three game losing streak, the Lobos were desperately hoping to flip that script and they found a way to do just that. In the end the Lobos swept the Miners, who now stand at 6-22 for the season, in three straight sets, 25-16, 25-16 and 28-26. In a press release, redshirt junior Victoria Spragg said, \"We've kind of been going up and down...so today was just a little redemption and showing ourselves and the fans that we can play volleyball\u201d.",

Pictures and sports memorabilia from the archives at UNM\u2019s Center for Southwest Research and Special Collections have been painstakingly assembled by a team of staff and students lead by University archivist Portia Vescio. In an interview Vescio said, \u201cAs the University Archivist my job is to research and work with the university\u2019s historical records. I always knew I was going to do something about UNM sports history.\u201d Vescio went on to say, \u201cI really wanted to show the evolution of sports history [at UNM] from this program where you have one building and you have to put equipment outside because it is too small...It has had its ups and downs and good and bad things have happened...\u201d Indeed, the introductory placard for the Lobomania exhibit acknowledged this fact, stating, \u201cThe road to success was rocky at times.

But like many good things in life, nothing lasts forever. Around 2008 the quality of cartoons began to deteriorate.

A critically acclaimed series during its original run, Samurai Jack was widely praised for its art style, camera angles, use of silence, and cinematography highly influenced by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Like most series of its time in the early 2000\u2019s, it faced the chopping block to pave the way for newer \u2014 and not necessarily better \u2014 series. This left a bitter taste in the mouths of its dedicated fan base. The show\u2019s creator, Russian-born Genndy Tartakovsky of \u201cDexter\u2019s Laboratory\u201d fame, has returned for the new episodes, making this a reboot not for the sake of rebooting but for closure, as the series never had a proper finale during its original run.",

Each song serves as a puzzle piece to a larger image but, as the album continues it\u2019s evident that the pieces to this circular narrative aren\u2019t for the same puzzle.
